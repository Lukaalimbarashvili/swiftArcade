1. Type Inference - Swift compiler can deduce type of variable. <br /> <br /> 
2. Ternary conditional operator - (`<CONDITION>`) ? `<TRUE VALUE>` : `<FALSE VALUE>` <br /> <br />
3. Countable closed range
``` swift
let closedRange = 0...5
```
4. Countable half-open range
``` swift
let halfOpenRange = 0..<5
```
